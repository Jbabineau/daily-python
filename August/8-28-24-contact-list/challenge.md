# How the project works

1. The program prompts the user to enter a name (e.g., John Smith) and then a phone number (e.g., 0011220011). 
1. The program keeps asking the user to enter more names and phone numbers until the user enters “done”. 
1. If the user enters “done”, the program creates a new “contacts.txt”* file and saves the data there.
